HUB - an attempt to store useful shortcuts and online links under one roof with a particular emphasis on personalisation.

BUGS - added item/s on game tab don't show up until atleast one item is added to website tab. Only god knows why.

When cloning, restore NuGet packages and manually fix the 4 references. Not sure why it doesn't restore correctly.
